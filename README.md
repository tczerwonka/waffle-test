# waffle-test

We are the waffle turtles!

The Waffle Turtles are a First Lego League team.  This year we chose to use
*Python* with our new Spike Prime robots and the Spike Prime version 3 app. 

We had to overcome a lot of obstacles before we could be productive.  

We are providing some working examples in our github repository hoping that
we can jump-start you and your team to become productve with coding in Python.
